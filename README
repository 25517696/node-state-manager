Build Dependencies and Instructions
-----------------------------------

The NodeStateManager needs glib >= 2.30.0 to be compiled.
In addition, the NodeStateManager(NSM) has dependencies
to the NodeStateMachine (NSMC) and NodeStateAccess (NSMA).

The NSMC and NSMA are delivered within this package as
stubs. To understand the tasks of these two components,
please see their interface headers.

Please note: Due to legal restrictions the NSMA had to be
introduced. It is responsible for binding the NSM to the
IPC. In most cases probably D-Bus is used for the IPC and
the xml files in the "model" folder of the NSM describe the
IPC interfaces offered by the NSM.
